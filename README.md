## Collaboration

This project was a collaborative effort; I worked alongside @jazz-y.

- I programmed the front end using React, while jazz-y programmed the back end using Express (Node.js)

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
