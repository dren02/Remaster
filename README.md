## Collaboration

This project was a collaborative effort; I worked alongside @jazz-y.

- I programmed the front end using React, while jazz-y programmed the back end using Express (Node.js)

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
<br>

Download the necessary dependencies to start the react application

```bash
cd this-project
npm install
```
The front end will be accessible at http://localhost:3000
```bash
npm start
```
<br>
Install the required <b>backend</b> dependencies and packages. Then, start the servers to begin using the app.

```bash
cd server
npm install

npm run dev
```
